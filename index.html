            <p> In a world of diverse cultures, economies, and societies, the concept of happiness is a fascinating 
                subject of exploration. Are all countries <span class="highlight">equally happy</span>, or does 
                happiness <span class="highlight">vary significantly</span> from one to another? <br><br> 
                
                This world map offers a look into the diverse happiness score among different countries, categorised

            <h2>The Pursuit of Happiness</h2>
            <p> While some countries consistently rank among the happiest in the world, the question arises: 
                <span class="highlight">Are they always that happy?</span> <br><br>

                Let's delve into the chart and explore some of the happiest nations in the world. We can see that 
                <span class="highlight">Denmark</span> has maintained in the <span class="highlight">top 5</span> 
                position every year since <span class="highlight">2010</span>. This is followed by 
                <span class="highlight">Finland</span> which has been in the <span class="highlight">top 8</span> 
                since <span class="highlight">2010</span> and more impressively, stayed on the <span class="highlight">
                1st</span> since <span class="highlight">2015</span>.

            <h2>Cultural Contrast</h2>
            <p> For generations, it's been a common belief that <span class="highlight">Western</span> societies 
                lean towards <span class="highlight">individualism</span>, while <span class="highlight">Asian</span> 
                countries gravitate towards <span class="highlight">collectivism</span>. But is this really the case, 
                or do the nuances of culture and society reveal a more intricate story? <br><br>

                Our exploration examines the concept of <span class="highlight">social support</span>, a critical facet 
                of well-being that reflects the strength of communal bonds. Here, social support is calculated from a 
                wide range of participants with answers yes (1) or no (0). Hence, ranging from 0 to 1, the chart shows 
                the average answer from various countries. Based on the data sourced, <span class="highlight">western 
                countries' average social support is 0.8</span>. So, let's look at how do asian countries compare:

            <h2>Well-being & Prosperity</h2>
            <p> In the pursuit of happiness and prosperity, societies often grapple with a fundamental question:  
                <span class="highlight">Does financial affluence translate into greater life satisfaction</span>,
                or is it the other way around? <br><br> 
                
                Let us dive into the intricate relationship between a nation's <span class="highlight">Gross Domestic 
                Product (GDP)</span> and the <span class="highlight">happiness</span> of its people. GDP is used as a 
                metric to measure a single country's economic health. The bubble plot categorises the data into different 
                regions throughout numerous years. Besides, feel free to click on a specific country in the legend to
